    Hi, I'm Lucy. I'm a peace, war, and defense and computer science major, currently enrolled in the Intermediate Technical Interview Prep Course at CodePath. 
    I have experience in data migration, security features mapping, and more. 
    I'm interested in combining my knowledge in peace, war, and defense with computer science to explore government-related opportunities.
